<h1>Hi, welcome to my website!</h1>
<p>
	My name is Pawe≈Ç B≈Çaszczyk, I'm a frontend developer from Poland. It's nice to see you on my blog,
	where I'd like to share my thoughts about the past, present, and future of the web development
	landmark. I always look forward to seeing new and innovative things happen on the web. Currently,
	I'm a hell of enthusiastic about Svelte and what it'll bring into modern front-end development.
	Moreover, I'm always excited about Typescript and the direction in which the JavaScript world is
	evolving.
</p>
<p>
	I'm fond of simplifying (sometimes even oversimplifying) things, making the web as accessible as
	it can be (though I'm still a newbie on that one), and trying new technologies. To make my
	horizons wider, I'd like to try things such as Deno, Lit, GraphQL, and Vue.js.
</p>
<p>
	Besides, I find testing really enjoyable and I'm hoping to learn more of it, so foresee coverage
	(pun intended) on that as well. Lastly, I wish you'll have a ball browsing some of my thoughts,
	have a nice day!
